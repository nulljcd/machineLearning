# machineLearning
Exporing machine learning.

### I plan to implement:
- artificial neural network (ANN)
- back propagation
- deep genetic algorithm (DeepGA), neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT)
- stochastic gradient descent (SGD), adaptable moment estimation (ADAM) and other learning acceleration techniques
- proximal policy optimization (PPO)

### notes
- easily portable to any lang
- no external libraries
- prioritize readability over speed
