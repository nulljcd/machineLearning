# machineLearning
Exporing machine learning.

### I plan to implement:
- artificial neural network (ANN) with back propagation
- stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
- neuroevolution and proximal policy optimization (PPO)

### notes:
- easily portable to any lang
- no external libraries
- prioritize readability over speed
