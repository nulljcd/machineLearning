# machineLearning
Exporing machine learning.

- vanilla fully connected feed forward neural network
- backpropagation
- optimizers
- neuroevolution

## online demos 
- curve fitting (coming soon)
- car driving simulation with neuroevolution (coming later)

## notes:
- easily portable to any lang
- no external libraries
- prioritize readability over speed
