# machineLearning
Exporing machine learning.

### I plan to implement:
- artificial neural network (ANN) with back propagation
- stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and other learning acceleration techniques
- neuroevolution and proximal policy optimization (PPO)

## examples
curve fitting https://nulljcd.github.io/machineLearning/examples/curveFitting/

### notes:
- easily portable to any lang
- no external libraries
- prioritize readability over speed
